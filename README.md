===============

The Yeoman-Frontend is a Grails plugin used for managing and processing frontend developed with Yeoman. The plugin integrates the frontend (preserving the Yeoman's directory structure) with a Grails web container during development of Grails backend application; it assembles the frontend into a Web Application Archive (WAR) file during deployment of Grails application.
